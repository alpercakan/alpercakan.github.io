I am a computer science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Vipul Goyal](https://vipulgoyal.org/). My research interest is in quantum cryptography and more broadly, theoretical computer science.

This page is being updated. In the meantime, you can find my publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xyzj1-IAAAAJ&hl=en).
